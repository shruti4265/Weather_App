      <h1>About This Project</h1>
      <p>
        This weather app was built purely as a practice project to test API integration skills using the OpenWeatherMap API.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rain predictions might not always be accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s all just part of learning and experimenting with APIs, server-side rendering using Express & EJS, and making fun little projects 💡.
